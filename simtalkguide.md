It is to mention that this document is neither connected to Siemens AG in any way nor an official release.
The guide is oriented on the official docs and example models provided by Siemens AG.
With the release of SimTalk 2.0 a lot of changes in the were made, which can be found [here](https://docs.plm.automation.siemens.com/content/plant_sim_help/15.1/plant_sim_all_in_one_html/en_US/tecnomatix_plant_simulation_help/simtalk_reference/simtalk_20_and_simtalk_10_compared.html).
SimTalk 2.0 enables easier formatting and less code. Thatâ€™s why this style guide refers to version 2.0.
